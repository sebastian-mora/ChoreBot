# ChoreBot

This Python program will send sms through Gmail to my roomates. The message will contain one of 6 chores that are to be completed weekly. After the person has completed the chore they can respond and a verifcation request will be sent to the other roomate to verify the chore has been done. If the chore was not completed the person who was responsible will be reassigned another roomates chore for the week.
