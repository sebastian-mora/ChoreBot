# ChoreBot

This Python program will send sms through Twillo to my roommates. The message will contain one of 12 chores that are to be completed weekly. After the person has completed the chore they can respond and a verifcation request will be sent to the other roommate to verify the chore has been done. If the chore was not completed the person who was responsible will be reassigned another roommates chore for the week.

Dependencies:
twililo-7.1.0
